Bidding Tab ideas:

Auction invenory sheet consists of a form for non profits to enter information about each auction item.

Auction inventory sheet:


It includes things like the Auction name to which this item is attached, item name, quantity of the item that will be bid for as a single unit, starting bid price, donor, selling price, condition, and any additional comments. The form also has a place for indicating approximate size, and storage location, so that we can find the item


Flow:

List of Auctions > List of Auction Items > Auction item detail page

Initial list of auctions should be accessable from Bidding tab (Maybe a drop down option called "Auctions" under bidding). Auction items page should also be accessable from the calendar when a user clicks the auction.
